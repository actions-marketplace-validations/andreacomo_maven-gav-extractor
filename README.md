# Maven GAV Extractor

![Maven GAV Extractor](https://github.com/andreacomo/maven-gav-extractor/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

This *GitHub Action* extracts GAV from `pom.xml`, i.e.:
 
 * `groupId`
 * `artifactId`
 * `version`

Why should I need this? For example, to **name** and **tag** a Docker image built upon your artifact or **pass as parameters** to a dispatched workflow.

## Prerequirements

This action expects you to have `maven` available in your workflow environment

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Default | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pom-location` | Full path to your project `pom.xml` file | `${{ github.workspace }}/pom.xml` | `true` |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `group-id` | Group Id of your project |
| `artifact-id` | Artifact Id of your project |
| `version` | Version of your project |

## Example usage
